Using Jupyter notebooks and the open source Python library, Pandas, we are able to group the data into various charts for comparison. 
Anaconda environment with python enabled

## Overview of project
Background
The school board has notified Maria and her supervisor that the students_complete.csv file shows evidence of academic dishonesty; specifically, reading and math grades for Thomas High School ninth graders appear to have been altered. Although the school board does not know the full extent of the academic dishonesty, they want to uphold state-testing standards and have turned to Maria for help. She has asked you to replace the math and reading scores for Thomas High School with NaNs while keeping the rest of the data intact. Once youâ€™ve replaced the math and reading scores, Maria would like you to repeat the school district analysis that you did in this module and write up a report to describe how these changes affected the overall analysis.

## Results
After making the changes there are a few things to notice instantly:
The overall passing percent increased 25 percent from 65 - 90.
Before removing the ninth graders from Thomas High School they were a bottom five school. Once the data had been updated they were now a top five school.

## Summary
With the refined data about all the schools in the district. The school board should be able to better asses the allegations of academic dishonesty, and re evaluate their spending per school more confidently.
